# NEAT-Python-Module
Computer Science NEA Project created by Freddie Bobbin

**NEAT requires the use of Python 3.10**

NEAT contains the python files for the NEAT-Python-Module. 

XOR contains:
  The config file which for evolving ANNs that can compute the XOR function.
  THe parameters can be editted and you can look for differences in the ANNs.
  
  main.py contains the fitness function for XOR and the code which
  creates the user interface so you can control the evolutionary process.
  
  use_network.py loads an ANN stored as a text file and evaluates the XOR inputs.
  The name of the file must be specified.
