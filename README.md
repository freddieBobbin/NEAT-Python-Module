# NEAT-Python-Module
Computer Science NEA Project created by Freddie Bobbin

This Python module is used to optimise artificial neural networks using the NEAT algorithm.
A GUI is provided that allows the user to view statistics and see the structure of their
ANNs.

This youtube video explains how to use the module:

**NEAT** contains the python files for the NEAT-Python-Module. 

**XOR** contains:
 
 The config file for evolving ANNs that can compute the XOR function.
 The parameters can be editted and you can look for differences in the ANNs.
  
 main.py contains the fitness function for XOR and the code which
 creates the user interface so you can control the evolutionary process.
  
 use_network.py loads an ANN stored as a text file and evaluates the XOR inputs.
 The name of the file must be specified.
